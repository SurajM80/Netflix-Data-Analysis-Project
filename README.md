## üìä Project Overview

Thrilled to share a recent data analysis project where I dove deep into Netflix's vast content library. The goal was to extract meaningful insights from Netflix's extensive dataset, understanding content distribution and audience preferences. This project honed my skills in data manipulation, visualization, and insight extraction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python:** The core language for the analysis.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and cleaning.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating compelling data visualizations.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For writing and presenting the code.

## üîç Key Analysis & Insights

This project involved several key steps to turn raw data into actionable insights:

* **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Systematically handled missing values and ensured overall data quality for accurate analysis.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized distributions of genres, release years, and content types (Movies vs. TV Shows).
* **Trend Identification:** Analyzed the growth of content added to the platform over the years and identified the most popular and saturated genres.
* **Rating Analysis:** Investigated the distribution of content ratings to understand audience preferences.
